        Metaphor is for most people a device of the poetic imagination and the rhetorical flourish-a matter of extraordinary rather than ordinary language. Moreover, metaphor is typically viewed as characteristic of language alone, a matter of words rather than thought or action. For this reason, most people think they can get along perfectly well without metaphor.

        We have found, on the contrary, that metaphor is pervasive in everyday life, not just in language but in thought and action.

        The concepts that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern our everyday functioning, down to the most mundane details.

        But our conceptual system is not something we are normally aware of. In most of the little things we do every day, we simply think and act more or less automatically along certain lines. Just what these lines are is by no means obvious. One way to find out is by looking at language. Since communication is based on the same conceptual system that we use
